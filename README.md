Investigating deep neural networks for facial expression recognistion

<h2>Motivation</h2>

Facial Expression Recognition in uncontrolled real-life
environment which is also known as facial expression
recognition in the wild has become an important research
topic as it plays a pivotal role in intelligent social interaction. Also, according to, most of the traditional
facial expression recognition systems mainly are focused
only on the captured frontal face expressions performed by
actors in controlled environments and therefore facial expression
recognition in the wild will be more challenging
due to factors such as different poses of the face, changes
in illuminations in the face and subtle expression variations
shown by real people in low resolution images. According
to in general, features are extracted from the inputted
facial images manually or automatically and using
these features these inputted images are classified in to one
of the basic six facial expressions (i.e., happiness, surprise,
disgust, fear, sadness, anger) as described in.
